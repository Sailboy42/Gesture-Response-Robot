# Initial static report site

Added a simple static website to host the project report and project updates.
This replaces the previous demo-focused homepage.

This repository previously included an updates-as-markdown workflow. That
feature has been removed and the site now only contains the static project
report. The original update content is preserved here for history.

# Archived: initial static report site

This update entry was archived and the updates workflow removed per repository
cleanup.
